# xray-reality
This is a Bash script that installs Xray Beta and downloads the configuration for the repository created by [Teegrce](https://twitter.com/Teegrce) for Iran inside this repository with your own key and places it only with one command :)
## Installation Guide
I just need you to run this command
```
# bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajjaddg/xray-reality/master/install.sh)"
``` 
and it will do the rest for you.

## Note
1. I have only tested it on Ubuntu 22 and wrote it for that system. Although I have the time and willingness to write it for other systems, I don't think I will need to do so unless I am forced to.
2. I used ChatGPT to translate my words. Please pardon any mistakes in the translation.

## ToDo
- [ ] Add menu
- [ ] test it on other OS and modify the script for them
